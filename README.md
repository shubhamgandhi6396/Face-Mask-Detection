<div align= "center">
  <h4>Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning in OpenCV and Keras/ Tensorflow. System Predicts whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in Images as well as Live Video</h4>
</div>



## :innocent: Motivation
The COVID-19 mask detector we are planning to build today could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others. It can help the universities collect data on how many students and staff are actually abiding by the rules on safety. Informed decisions can be made to further plan the functioning of buildings and campus areas.

## :warning: Technologies used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## :star: Features
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://www.kaggle.com/prasoonkottarathil/face-mask-lite-dataset)

This dataset consists of __20000 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 10000 images__
*	__without_mask: 10000 images__

We have used only 3000 Images from both classes. (6000 Total)
