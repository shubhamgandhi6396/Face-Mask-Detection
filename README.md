## :innocent: Motivation
The COVID-19 mask detector we are planning to build today could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others. It can help the universities collect data on how many students and staff are actually abiding by the rules on safety. Informed decisions can be made to further plan the functioning of buildings and campus areas.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://www.kaggle.com/prasoonkottarathil/face-mask-lite-dataset)

This dataset consists of __20000 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 10000 images__
*	__without_mask: 10000 images__

We have used only 3000 Images from both classes. (6000 Total)
